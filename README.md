# Block-Chain Voting System

Welcome to the Block-Chain Voting System repository! This project showcases a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting system leveraging blockchain technology. Designed to enhance the integrity and trustworthiness of the voting process, this system ensures that every vote is counted accurately and cannot be altered.

This project is developed during the intern period **Oct 2023** - **Dec 2023** for **Varcons Technologies**.

## Features

- **Decentralized and Secure:** Utilizes blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and security of votes.
- **Transparency:** Provides a transparent process where all votes are visible on the blockchain.
- **Immutability:** Ensures that once a vote is cast, it cannot be changed or tampered with.
- **Anonymity:** Protects voter privacy by keeping votes anonymous.
- **Accessibility:** Easy to use interface for voters, election officials, and administrators.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Truffle framework
- Ganache (for local blockchain development)
- MetaMask (browser extension for Ethereum)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gjrahul1/Block-Chain_Voting-System.git
    cd Block-Chain_Voting-System
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Compile smart contracts:**
    ```bash
    truffle compile
    ```

4. **Migrate smart contracts to the blockchain:**
    ```bash
    truffle migrate
    ```

5. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

6. **Connect MetaMask to your local blockchain:**

    - Open MetaMask and connect to the local network provided by Ganache.
    - Import the account from Ganache to MetaMask using the private key.

### Usage

1. **Open the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
    
2. **Register as a voter:**
    Enter your details and register to vote. The system will store your information securely on the blockchain.
    
3. **Cast your vote:**
    Choose your preferred candidate and submit your vote. Your vote will be recorded on the blockchain and cannot be altered.
    
4. **View election results:**
    After voting ends, view the transparent and immutable election results directly on the blockchain.
